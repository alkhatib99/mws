- [x] Store private keys using flutter_secure_storage or encrypted memory-only if in web.
- [ ] Update wallet_connect_controller to use enhanced services.
- [ ] Test wallet connectivity functionality.

## Phase 3: Enhance decentralization and smart contract integration
- [x] Remove any centralized APIs or gateways.
- [x] Ensure all operations use direct JSON-RPC calls to the blockchain.
- [x] Support user-defined RPC endpoints (Infura, Alchemy, or public RPC).
- [x] Avoid saving any user data or transaction history.
- [x] Create comprehensive transaction service with gas estimation.
- [x] Implement decentralized RPC service with multiple endpoints.
- [x] Create documentation explaining DApp decentralization.

## Phase 4: Optimize performance and implement caching
- [x] Create a TransactionService.
- [x] Estimate gas using client.estimateGas dynamically.
- [x] Handle insufficient funds or underpriced gas errors.
- [x] Ensure proper nonce management for multi-send transactions (fetch getTransactionCount before each tx).
- [x] Add loading states for sending & confirmations.
- [x] Implement comprehensive caching service.
- [x] Create performance monitoring service.
- [x] Enhance balance service with caching and real-time updates.

## Phase 5: Enhance UI/UX with responsive design and accessibility
- [x] Display connected wallet address.
- [x] Display current chain/network.
- [x] Display balance.
- [x] Add hover effects to buttons (styled via MouseRegion) and feedback after sending.
- [x] Fix overflow issues and ensure responsiveness across desktop and mobile.
- [x] Implement responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- [x] Add smooth animations and hover effects.
- [x] Create modern glassmorphism design elements.
- [x] Implement enhanced wallet cards with animations.
- [x] Create responsive network selector.
- [x] Build wallet status card with expandable details.
- [x] Design enhanced text fields with validation.
- [x] Create responsive helper utility.

- [x] Use dart:html only when running on the web.
- [x] Add a warning for users about using private keys in the browser.
- [x] Cross-platform testing (Web: Chrome, Brave, Firefox; Devices: Android, iPhone, Desktop (Mac/Win)).
- [x] Test private key login.
- [x] Create comprehensive security utilities with encryption.
- [x] Implement validation utilities for all inputs.
- [x] Build error handling system with proper categorization.
- [x] Add comprehensive test suite for security functions.
- [x] Implement platform-specific code for web/mobile compatibility.
- [x] Create password strength validation and secure storage.
## Phase 7: Deploy and deliver final DApp with documentation
- [x] Create comprehensive README with setup instructions.
- [x] Write detailed ROADMAP with future development plans.
- [x] Create DEPLOYMENT guide for all platforms.
- [x] Document security features and best practices.
- [x] Prepare project for production deployment.
- [x] Create technical documentation for developers.
