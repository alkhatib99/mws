# How MWS (Multi Wallet Sender) Works

## Overview

MWS (Multi Wallet Sender) is a **fully decentralized application (DApp)** that allows users to send cryptocurrency to multiple wallet addresses simultaneously. The application operates entirely on the client-side without any backend servers, ensuring complete user privacy and security.

## üîí Decentralization & Privacy

### No Backend Server
- **Zero server dependency**: All operations happen directly in your browser
- **No user data storage**: We never store, collect, or transmit your personal information
- **No transaction history**: Your transaction data remains private and local
- **No account creation**: No registration, emails, or personal details required

### Client-Side Only Operations
- All wallet connections are handled locally in your browser
- Private keys (if imported) are encrypted and stored only in browser memory
- All blockchain interactions use direct JSON-RPC calls to public nodes
- No intermediary services or APIs for transaction processing

## üîó How Wallet Connection Works

### 1. MetaMask Browser Extension
- **Direct Integration**: Connects directly to your MetaMask extension
- **No Private Key Exposure**: Uses MetaMask's secure signing mechanism
- **Automatic Network Detection**: Detects and switches between supported networks
- **Real-time Updates**: Listens for account and network changes

### 2. WalletConnect Protocol
- **QR Code Connection**: Scan QR code with your mobile wallet
- **Deep Link Support**: Direct connection to supported mobile wallets
- **Secure Communication**: End-to-end encrypted communication channel
- **Multi-Wallet Support**: Works with Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, and more

### 3. Private Key Import (Advanced Users)
- **Local Encryption**: Private keys are encrypted with your password
- **Memory-Only Storage**: Keys stored only in browser memory, never on disk
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Keys are cleared when you close the browser
- **Security Warning**: Clear warnings about browser-based private key usage

## üåê Blockchain Interaction

### Decentralized RPC Network
- **Multiple Public Nodes**: Uses multiple public RPC endpoints for redundancy
- **Automatic Failover**: Switches to backup nodes if primary fails
- **Custom RPC Support**: Add your own RPC endpoints (Infura, Alchemy, etc.)
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuously monitors RPC endpoint health

### Supported Networks
- **Ethereum Mainnet**: Native ETH transactions
- **Binance Smart Chain**: BNB and BEP-20 tokens
- **Polygon**: MATIC and Polygon tokens
- **Base**: Coinbase's Layer 2 network
- **Arbitrum**: Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution
- **Optimism**: Another Ethereum Layer 2 solution

### Gas Optimization
- **Dynamic Gas Estimation**: Real-time gas price estimation from multiple sources
- **Median Gas Pricing**: Uses median gas price from multiple RPC endpoints
- **Smart Gas Limits**: Automatic gas limit estimation with safety buffers
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with adjusted gas prices if transactions fail

## üí∏ Multi-Send Transaction Process

### 1. Transaction Preparation
- **Address Validation**: Validates all recipient addresses before sending
- **Balance Checking**: Ensures sufficient balance for all transactions
- **Gas Calculation**: Calculates total gas costs for all transactions
- **Nonce Management**: Proper nonce sequencing for multiple transactions

### 2. Transaction Execution
- **Sequential Processing**: Sends transactions in order to maintain nonce sequence
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks transaction status and confirmations
- **Error Handling**: Continues with remaining transactions if one fails
- **Confirmation Tracking**: Monitors blockchain confirmations for each transaction

### 3. Transaction Security
- **Local Signing**: All transactions signed locally in your browser
- **No Transaction Relay**: Direct submission to blockchain networks
- **Transparent Fees**: Clear display of all gas costs before confirmation
- **Immutable Records**: All transactions recorded on public blockchain

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Private Key Protection
- **Never Transmitted**: Private keys never leave your device
- **Encrypted Storage**: If imported, keys are encrypted with your password
- **Memory-Only**: No persistent storage of sensitive data
- **Automatic Cleanup**: All data cleared on browser close

### Transaction Security
- **Local Validation**: All transaction data validated locally
- **Secure Signing**: Uses wallet's native signing mechanisms
- **No Proxy Contracts**: Direct blockchain interaction without intermediaries
- **Transparent Operations**: All code is open-source and auditable

### Network Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All connections use secure HTTPS protocol
- **No Third-Party Tracking**: No analytics or tracking scripts
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers prevent XSS attacks
- **Subresource Integrity**: Ensures loaded resources haven't been tampered with

## üîç What Data We DON'T Collect

### Personal Information
- ‚ùå No email addresses or personal details
- ‚ùå No wallet addresses or balances
- ‚ùå No transaction history or amounts
- ‚ùå No IP addresses or location data
- ‚ùå No usage analytics or tracking

### Technical Data
- ‚ùå No private keys or seed phrases
- ‚ùå No transaction signatures
- ‚ùå No wallet connection details
- ‚ùå No network preferences
- ‚ùå No error logs or debugging data

## üåü Benefits of Decentralization

### Complete Privacy
- Your financial data remains completely private
- No corporate surveillance or data mining
- No risk of data breaches or leaks
- Full control over your information

### Censorship Resistance
- No central authority can block your transactions
- Works as long as blockchain networks are operational
- No account freezing or service termination
- Global accessibility without restrictions

### Trustless Operation
- No need to trust a company with your funds
- Transparent, auditable code
- Direct blockchain interaction
- Self-sovereign financial operations

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Connect Your Wallet**: Choose from MetaMask, WalletConnect, or private key import
2. **Select Network**: Choose your preferred blockchain network
3. **Add Recipients**: Enter multiple wallet addresses (one per line or upload file)
4. **Set Amount**: Specify the amount to send to each address
5. **Review & Send**: Confirm transaction details and gas costs
6. **Monitor Progress**: Track transaction confirmations in real-time

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

### Browser-Based Private Keys
If you choose to import a private key:
- Only use on trusted, secure devices
- Never use your main wallet's private key
- Consider using a dedicated wallet for multi-send operations
- Always clear browser data after use

### Network Security
- Always verify you're on the correct network
- Double-check all recipient addresses
- Start with small test amounts
- Keep your wallet software updated

### Transaction Finality
- Blockchain transactions are irreversible
- Always verify recipient addresses
- Consider the gas costs for failed transactions
- Monitor network congestion for optimal timing

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Frontend Technology
- **Flutter Web**: Cross-platform web application framework
- **Web3Dart**: Ethereum blockchain interaction library
- **ReownAppKit**: WalletConnect v2 protocol implementation
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Blockchain Integration
- **Direct RPC Calls**: No intermediary APIs or services
- **Multiple RPC Endpoints**: Redundancy and reliability
- **Real-time Event Listening**: Account and network change detection
- **Gas Optimization**: Smart gas price and limit calculation

### Security Implementation
