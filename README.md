   ```

   For Desktop:

   ```bash
   flutter run -d windows  # or macos/linux
   ```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# RPC Endpoints (optional - defaults provided)
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY
BSC_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com/

# WalletConnect Project ID (optional)
WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

## 📖 Usage Guide

### 1. Connect Your Wallet

Choose from three connection methods:

**MetaMask (Web)**

- Click "MetaMask" card
- Approve connection in MetaMask extension
- Select account and network

**WalletConnect (Mobile)**

- Click "WalletConnect" card
- Scan QR code with mobile wallet
- Approve connection in wallet app

**Private Key Import**

- Click "Private Key" card
- Enter private key and password
- Key is encrypted and stored in memory only

### 2. Select Network

- Use the network selector to choose blockchain
- Supported networks: Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism
- Balance updates automatically when switching networks

### 3. Multi-Send Transaction

1. **Enter Recipients**

   - Add wallet addresses (one per line)
   - Supports up to 100 recipients
   - Automatic address validation
2. **Set Amount**

   - Enter amount per recipient
   - Use "MAX" button for maximum balance
   - Real-time balance validation
3. **Send Transaction**

   - Review transaction details
   - Confirm gas fees
   - Sign transaction in wallet

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Private Key Usage

- Private keys are encrypted in memory only
- Never stored permanently on device
- Use strong passwords for encryption
- Only use on trusted devices

### Web Security

- HTTPS required for production
- MetaMask connection is secure
- No data sent to external servers
- All operations are client-side

### Best Practices

- Always verify recipient addresses
- Start with small test amounts
- Keep private keys secure
- Use hardware wallets when possible
