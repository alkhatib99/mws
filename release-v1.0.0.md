## Project Structure and Code Cleanliness

In this release, significant effort was dedicated to refining the project's internal architecture to adhere to best practices in Flutter development. The folder structure has been meticulously organized to promote modularity, maintainability, and scalability. Common widgets, previously scattered across various view-specific directories, have been consolidated into a central `lib/widgets/` folder. This ensures reusability, reduces code duplication, and simplifies future development and debugging efforts. Deprecated code and unused packages have been systematically removed, contributing to a leaner and more efficient codebase. Furthermore, the implementation of GetX for state management, routing, and dependency injection has been rigorously reviewed and restructured to ensure proper bindings and controller separation, aligning with clean architecture principles. This foundational work provides a solid and stable platform for ongoing development and future feature integrations.

## UI/UX Review and Styling Enhancements

The user interface and experience have undergone a comprehensive overhaul, drawing inspiration from modern Web3 design principles and specific aesthetic references such as bagguild.com and dapp.bagguild.com. The splash screen now maintains a longer display duration, providing a more polished and engaging initial user interaction. On the main screen, the application now features a prominently centered logo, accompanied by the stylishly rendered text "MWS DApp" directly below it. This text is no longer curved, but rather perfectly straight and centered, with an enhanced visual appeal that includes a gradient background, rounded corners, and subtle shadow effects.

Styling enhancements extend throughout the application, incorporating subtle animations, ensuring font consistency (primarily using Montserrat), and meticulously adjusting padding and spacing to mirror the clean and professional aesthetic of the dApp reference site. Interactive components, particularly buttons, now exhibit sophisticated hover effects, providing intuitive visual feedback and a premium feel. The overall design language emphasizes a modern, polished, and responsive user experience, adapting seamlessly across various device form factors.

## WalletConnect & Wallet UI

The wallet connection and interaction experience have been significantly improved to offer a more intuitive and visually appealing interface. The modal now clearly displays various wallet options, including MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, Ledger (via WalletConnect), and Phantom (for Solana), each accompanied by its respective logo for easy identification. This dialog is fully responsive, ensuring optimal usability across both desktop and mobile views.

### Balance Display

Users can now clearly view their wallet balance immediately after connection. This feature dynamically fetches and displays the available balance for the currently selected network, providing real-time financial oversight. The balance is presented within a modern, animated card that includes the token symbol, name, and logo, enhancing visual clarity and user engagement.

### Currency Selection

Beyond just ETH, the application now supports the selection of multiple currencies/tokens for transfer. This includes popular assets like USDC, USDT, DAI, BNB, and CAKE. When a network is chosen, the system intelligently fetches and displays all available balances for the supported tokens within that specific network. Each currency/token option is visually represented with its corresponding logo, further enriching the user experience.

### Dynamic Amount Input and USD Estimation

The amount input field has been refined for a more intuitive user experience. It is now only editable when a token is selected, preventing premature input. The field dynamically updates to show the selected token's symbol, and a real-time estimated value in USD is displayed as the user types, providing immediate financial context. A convenient 'MAX' button allows users to quickly populate the input field with their entire available balance for the selected token.

## DApp Identity & Decentralization

As a Decentralized Application (DApp), MWS strictly adheres to principles of decentralization and user privacy. This release confirms and reinforces the following core tenets:

* **No User Data Storage**: The application is designed to operate without storing any user data on a backend server. All sensitive information and transaction details remain client-side.
* **Client-Side Transactions**: All transactions and wallet interactions are executed purely client-side, ensuring that users maintain full control over their assets and data.
* **Wallet-Based Access**: Access to the DApp is exclusively wallet-based, eliminating the need for a central database or traditional authentication mechanisms. This approach enhances security and aligns with the decentralized ethos.

To further clarify the application's operational model and commitment to decentralization, a dedicated file, `how_mws_works.md`, has been created. This document provides a concise explanation of the application's functionality, elaborates on its decentralized nature, explicitly states the non-storage of user data, and details the mechanisms of wallet connection and transaction handling via Web3 technologies.

## README Update

The `README.md` file has been comprehensively updated to reflect the current state and capabilities of the MWS DApp. Key additions include:

* A clear declaration that MWS is a Decentralized Application (DApp).
* Detailed project setup instructions, guiding new users through the process of getting the application up and running locally.
* An updated tech stack section, explicitly listing Flutter, GetX, and Web3Dart as core technologies.
* An explanation of how wallet connection works within the DApp.
* Links to the design reference styles from bagguild.com, providing context for the application's visual design.

This updated README serves as a central resource for developers and users, ensuring clarity and ease of access to essential project information.
